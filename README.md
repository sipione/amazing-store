# amazing-store-Ricardo-Sipione-Augusto

An multi-currencies e-commerce using Apollo-client to consume the data, React, react-router-dom and styled-components. Working on http://amazing.sipione.tech and the back-end is on the heroku


## Overview

An SPA front-end ecommerce system to consume from a graphQL backend. The store was demanded only for desktop, thus responsivity was not demanded, that's why the next feature is going to be able to be opened in a smartphone.

The website supports a lot of interactions, like add to cart in the categories page a product with some standard attributes. If the user wants to choose the attributes it is possible to go to the product page and change the attributes. The buy button is just allowed when the product is in stock. After adding in the cart it is not possible to change the attributes of the item, but it is possible to add more items. Removal is possible easily, but in the last item in the cart the user just deletes the item from the cart after a brief confirmation.
